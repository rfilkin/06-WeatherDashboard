# 06-WeatherDashboard
This is a weather app that can be used to search and display weather for various cities.

A sidebar on the left will display recent searches as buttons, and clicking these buttons will repeat their search. These recent searches are stored in local storage.

The most recent search (whether by search bar or clicking a search button) will be displayed when the page is reloaded.

At the top-right of the page, the current weather for the searched city will be displayed.
Below that, a series of 5 boxes will display the weather forecast for the next 5 days at the city's location.

Note: there appears to be a glitch when searching or clicking a recent-search button, where the weather icon on the top of the page won't display. This can be fixed by refreshing the page.
